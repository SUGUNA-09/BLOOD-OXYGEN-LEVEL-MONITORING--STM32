ML-Based SpO2 Monitoring System




This project focuses on the development of a machine learning-based SpO2 monitoring system using the MAX30100 sensor, an STM32 microcontroller, and Random Forest Regression for accurate and continuous blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurement. The system is designed for real-time, portable, and efficient remote health monitoring applications.

Features
